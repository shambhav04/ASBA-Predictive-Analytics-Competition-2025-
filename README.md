# ASBA-Predictive-Analytics-Competition-2025-
Predicting Airbnb prices in Melbourne using Python and machine learning.
This project was completed as part of the BUSA3020 Advanced Analytics Techniques unit at Macquarie University.
The competition, hosted on Kaggle, involved predicting Airbnb listing prices across Melbourne, Australia using a dataset of property and host details.

### Objective

Predict Airbnb listing prices based on property and location features using machine learning models in Python.

### My Contribution

Worked in a team of three (Max Cochrane J.P, Rohini Maharaj, and myself) to:

- Clean and prepare the dataset for modelling

- Apply feature engineering techniques

- Build and tune predictive models

- Evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### Result

Our team, Back Benchers, placed 26th out of 106 groups, competing against both Bachelor and Master of Business Analytics students, including several already working in the industry.

### Tools & Libraries

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
