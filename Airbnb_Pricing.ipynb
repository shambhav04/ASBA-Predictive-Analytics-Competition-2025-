This forecasting capability is essential for delivering strategic business value across several segments of the short-term rental market. Precise price predictions can have significant implications in the following areas:\n\n**Host revenue optimisation**: \nHosts can use reliable price forecasts to avoid under-pricing (which would reduce their potential earnings) and over-pricing (which could deter prospective guests). By aligning their rates with anticipated demand and comparable listings, hosts maintain a competitive advantage and maximise occupancy.\n\n**Occupancy and yield management**:\nProperty managers and platform operators can leverage price forecasts to understand seasonal and local market trends. This insight enables informed decisions about when to adjust prices to smooth occupancy rates, thereby improving overall yield and reducing vacant nights.\n\n**Investment and portfolio planning**:\nInvestors and portfolio managers who hold multiple short-term rental properties can use forecasting to evaluate which neighbourhoods or property types are likely to yield higher returns. By anticipating price trends, they can make data-driven decisions about property acquisition, renovation budgets and targeted marketing campaigns.\n\nThese objectives align with the new dataset’s structure, which includes listing attributes such as location (neighbourhood), room type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, amenities, host experience and other listing details. Your task is to preprocess the data, engineer relevant features, and develop one or more machine learning models that can predict the “price” column for unseen listings (i.e. the test set), ensuring that the predictions are as accurate as possible.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **2. Evaluation Criteria**\n\nThe assignment uses Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to assess forecasting performance. MAPE is advantageous due to its interpretability, expressing errors as percentages. It measures relative errors, allowing for fair comparisons across different nightly price ranges. For example, a model that forecasts budget listings and one that forecasts premium listings can be compared on the same scale, making it easier to identify which model performs better regardless of the price level. Furthermore, MAPE encourages robust model development because it is sensitive to outliers. Its widespread use across various industries highlights its adaptability and encourages participants to iteratively refine their models.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **3.

training and test datasets are largely complete, with the train dataset exhibiting 97.23% data completeness and the test dataset showing 93.13% completeness. However, several features have missing values that could impact analytical outcomes if not addressed:\n\n**Train Dataset:**\n\n* `name` is missing in 1 listing (0.01%).\n* `description` is missing in 57 listings (0.81%).\n* `neighborhood_overview` is missing in 1 823 listings (26.04%).\n* All other columns have no missing entries.\n\nSince `neighborhood_overview` is absent for 26.04% of listings and `description` is missing for 0.81% of listings, these text fields will require either imputation (for example, filling with \"No overview provided\") or exclusion. The single missing `name` (0.01%) can be filled with a generic placeholder or removed without materially affecting the dataset.\n\n**Test Dataset:**\n\n* `description` is missing in 31 listings (1.03%).\n* `neighborhood_overview` is missing in 1 424 listings (47.47%).\n* `host_location` is missing in 770 listings (25.67%).\n* `host_about` is missing in 1 441 listings (48.03%).\n* `host_response_time` is missing in 737 listings (24.57%).\n* `host_response_rate` is missing in 737 listings (24.57%).\n* `host_acceptance_rate` is missing in 658 listings (21.93%).\n* `host_is_superhost` is missing in 2 listings (0.07%).\n* `host_neighbourhood` is missing in 2 066 listings (68.87%).\n* `neighbourhood` is missing in 1 424 listings (47.47%).\n* `neighbourhood_cleansed` is missing in 42 listings (1.40%).\n* `property_type` is missing in 39 listings (1.30%).\n* `room_type` is missing in 41 listings (1.37%).\n* `bedrooms` is missing in 60 listings (2.00%).\n* `beds` is missing in 12 listings (0.40%).\n* `minimum_minimum_nights` is missing in 10 listings (0.33%).\n* `maximum_maximum_nights` is missing in 10 listings (0.33%).\n* `availability_365` is missing in 20 listings (0.67%).\n* `first_review` is missing in 263 listings (8.77%).\n* `last_review` is missing in 263 listings (8.77%).\n* `review_scores_rating` is missing in 263 listings (8.77%).\n* `review_scores_accuracy` is missing in 299 listings (9.97%).\n* `review_scores_cleanliness` is missing in 299 listings (9.97%).\n* `review_scores_checkin` is missing in 300 listings (10.00%).\n* `review_scores_communication` is missing in 300 listings (10.00%).\n* `review_scores_location` is missing in 300 listings (10.00%).\n* `review_scores_value` is missing in 300 listings (10.00%).\n* `reviews_per_month` is missing in 263 listings (8.77%).\n\nThese gaps are concentrated in text fields such as `description`, `neighborhood_overview` and `host_about`, host-related attributes such as `host_location`, `host_response_time`, `host_response_rate`, `host_acceptance_rate` and `host_neighbourhood`, and review-related scores. Because many of these features carry important contextual or reputation information, a consistent strategy, such as imputing missing text as \"No data\", filling missing numerical scores with the column median and possibly dropping features with very high missingness, will be necessary.\n\nAddressing these missing values through targeted imputation or, where justified, removal will improve data reliability and ensure that subsequent analyses and models produce accurate, actionable insights.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **5.

Key Observations and Insights\n\n\n### Correlation & Univariate Data Characteristics\n\nTo uncover data insights, a heatmap was used to show relationships between different variables in ‘Train’, which assists in visualising their correlation. Additionally, summary statistics were performed to identify key characteristics in the data to determine range, variability and central tendency of the features. Both analyses can assist in decision making by highlighting which listing attributes most influence nightly price and where to focus feature engineering for model development.\n\n*Note: The heatmap shows only continuous, numerical variables prior to any data cleaning, transformation or extraction. This is a limitation when analysing correlations.*\n\n### Strong Positive Correlations\n\n* **Review Scores Rating x Review Scores Accuracy (0.89)**\n  Listings that score highly for overall rating also tend to score highly for accuracy. This suggests that accuracy of the listing description and amenities contributes significantly to guests’ overall satisfaction. For hosts, emphasising accurate photos and amenity details may improve both accuracy and overall rating.\n\n* **Review Scores Rating x Review Scores Value (0.85)**\n  Higher perceived value strongly aligns with a higher overall rating. Guests who feel they receive good value for money tend to rate the listing more favourably. Hosts targeting mid-to-long-stay bookings can focus on value-added services—such as flexible check-in or local guides—to boost both value and overall rating.\n\n* **Availability 30 x Availability 60 (0.89)**\n  Listings that are frequently available in the next 30 nights are also likely to be available over 60 nights. This consistency indicates that availability patterns remain stable over short-term windows. Property managers can use this insight for yield management by adjusting minimum-stay rules or pricing during low-availability periods.\n\n* **Bedrooms x Accommodates (0.86)**\n  Properties with more bedrooms naturally accommodate more guests. This correlation confirms that larger listings should be marketed at a premium per night compared to smaller units, especially for group travellers or families.\n\n### Strong Negative Correlations\n\n* **Reviews per Month x Number of Reviews (–0.35)**\n  A negative correlation exists because ‘number\\_of\\_reviews’ is cumulative while ‘reviews\\_per\\_month’ drops as time passes without new reviews. In practical terms, listings with very high total reviews might have few recent reviews, signalling a need to refresh marketing or update amenities to maintain guest interest.\n\n* **Number of Reviews x Availability 365 (–0.20)**\n  Listings with many reviews tend to be booked more often, resulting in lower overall annual availability. Hosts can track this metric to balance occupancy and allow for necessary maintenance windows.\n\n* **Review Scores Cleaning x Review Scores Check-in (–0.02)**\n  Though weak, a slight inverse relation suggests that very high cleanliness ratings correlate with marginally lower check-in satisfaction, possibly due to hosts prioritising cleaning over streamlined check-in. Understanding this trade-off may help hosts to balance both aspects effectively.\n\n### Weak Price Correlations\n\n* **Price x Bedrooms (0.08)**\n  The small positive relationship indicates that listings with more bedrooms generally cost more per night, but the effect is modest. Pricing strategy should also consider location, property type and guest ratings, not bedrooms alone.\n\n* **Price x Accommodates (0.04)**\n  A very weak positive link shows that the number of guests capacity has some influence on price but is not the primary driver. Hosts with high-capacity properties might need to rely on superior guest experience (ratings) and location to justify a higher nightly rate.\n\n### Univariate Data Characteristics\n\n* **‘Price’** ranges from \\$25 to \\$145 160, with a mean of \\$285.65 and a median of \\$172.00. The wide range indicates both budget-friendly and high-end listings in the market. A right-skewed distribution (mean > median) suggests some very expensive listings pulling the average up.\n\n* **‘Bedrooms’** ranges from 1 to 15, with a mean of 1.79 and a median of 1.00. Most listings have one or two bedrooms (75% have ≤2 bedrooms), indicating that smaller properties dominate the market.\n\n* **‘Accommodates’** spans from 1 to 30 guests, with a mean of 2.56 and a median of 2.00. Over 50% of listings accommodate two guests or fewer, reinforcing the prevalence of smaller, short-stay rentals.\n\n* **‘Number of Reviews’** ranges from 0 to 1 328, with a mean of 28.34 and a median of 10.00. A few listings have very high review counts, while the majority fall below 50 total reviews.\n\n* **‘Review Scores Rating’** spans from 0.00 to 5.00, with a mean of 4.82 and a median of 4.93. Most listings score above 4.50, showing that highly rated properties are the norm.\n\n* **‘Availability 365’** ranges from 0 to 365 days, with a mean of 177.85 and a median of 161.00. Half of all listings are available for 161 days or fewer per year, indicating moderate occupancy levels on average.\n\nBy examining both correlation and univariate characteristics, we can see that guest reviews and availability patterns are critical context for pricing. Hosts and platform managers should prioritise improving guest experiences and managing availability to optimise revenue.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#printing output heading\nprint(\"===============================================================\")\nprint(\"           Outlier Identification for both Datasets            \") \nprint(\"===============================================================\")\n\n#Identifying the outliers within the 'Train; and 'Test' Dataset using inter-quartile range\ndef find_outliers_IQR(train):\n   q1=numerical.quantile(0.25) #where majority of the data is located \n   q3=numerical.quantile(0.75) #where majority of the data is located\n   IQR=q3-q1\n\n#any data not in the majory range is flagged as an outlier\n   outliers = numerical[((numerical<(q1-1.5*IQR)) | (numerical>(q3+1.5*IQR)))] \n   return outliers\n\noutliers = find_outliers_IQR(numerical)\n\n#7000 is chosen as thats the max of values in 'Train' \n#[0:36] is used to index all the columns\nnum = 7000 - outliers.isnull().sum()[0:36] \n\nprint(\"---------------------------------------------------------------\")\nprint(\"Number of Outliers: Train Data\")\nprint(\"---------------------------------------------------------------\")\nfor column, count in num.items():\n    print(f\"{column}: {count}\")\n    \n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    \ndef find_outliers_IQR_test(numerical_test):\n    q1_test = numerical_test.quantile(0.25)\n    q3_test = numerical_test.quantile(0.75)\n    IQR_test=q3_test-q1_test\n\n    outliers_test = numerical_test[((numerical_test<(q1_test-1.5*IQR_test)) | (numerical_test>(q3_test+1.5*IQR_test)))]\n    return outliers_test\n\noutliers_test = find_outliers_IQR_test(numerical_test)\n\n#3000 is chosen as thats the max of values in 'Test'\n#[0:37] is used to index all the columns\nnum_test = 3000 - outliers_test.isnull().sum()[0:37]\n\nprint(\"---------------------------------------------------------------\")\nprint(\"Number of Outliers: Test Data\")\nprint(\"---------------------------------------------------------------\")\nfor column, count in num_test.items():\n    print(f\"{column}: {count}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The datasets reveal significant outliers across multiple variables, notably in:\n\n* **host\\_listings\\_count** (17.81% in the training set and 14.70% in the test set)\n* **latitude** (12.34% in the training set and 10.33% in the test set)\n* **longitude** (17.27% in the training set and 20.83% in the test set)\n* **minimum\\_nights** (12.61% in the training set and 9.87% in the test set)\n\nHigh outlier percentages in these features indicate geographic clustering of extreme values, for example listings located far from central areas, and irregular booking requirements, for example very high or very low minimum-night rules.

For instance, three commas means four amenities. This gives us a single integer showing how many extras the host provides, since more amenities often relate to a higher nightly rate.\n\n2) host_tenure_days\n\nSource data: Based on the host_since column, which records the date the host joined Airbnb.\n\nHow it’s made: We calculate today’s date (current = datetime.date.today()), convert the host’s join date to a pandas datetime, then subtract the join date from today. The result is the total number of days the host has been active. Hosts who have been around longer often charge more because they have built experience and trust.\n\n3) availability_ratio\n\nSource data: Taken from availability_365, the number of days the listing is available over the next year.\n\nHow it’s made: We divide the “days available” value by 365 to get a number between 0 and 1. A low ratio, close to 0, means the place is booked most of the year, indicating high demand and justifying a higher price. A high ratio, close to 1, means the listing is open nearly every day, suggesting lower demand.\n\n4) days_since_last_review\n\nSource data: Based on the last_review column, which shows the date of the most recent guest review.\n\nHow it’s made: We subtract the date of the last review from today’s date (current = datetime.date.today()), after converting both to pandas datetime. The result is how many days have passed since someone last reviewed the listing. Listings with very recent reviews tend to be more active, which can support a premium rate.\n\n5) superhost_flag\n\nSource data: Taken from host_is_superhost, which indicates whether the host is a Superhost (“t” for true or “f” for false).\n\nHow it’s made: We check if host_is_superhost equals “t” and convert that to 1; otherwise we use 0. A value of 1 shows the host is a Superhost, a status that often allows them to charge more because guests trust them more.\n\n6) neighbourhood_review_density\n\nSource data: Combines number_of_reviews (total reviews) with availability_365 (days the listing is available in a year).\n\nHow it’s made: We divide total reviews by the number of available days. This tells us how many reviews the listing receives on average for each day it is open. A higher density indicates popularity, which usually corresponds to a higher price.\n\nSix features give the model more validity by adding host reputation and listing popularity, making price predictions more accurate.
